About parser:

Attached IEEE file
I will check nom(2418) since it's mentioned in a litrev file (check attachment)
Other options are LALRPOP(765), pest(1054), combine(529), rust-peg (501), oak (109).

Seems LALRPOP is a bit slower than nom

On the other hand nom is as he said, better for binary files more than PL files.

pest is the simplest one LALRPOP is more focused on PL and nom is the general purpose, after checking all 3,
I will decide what to use. LALRPOP seemed nice at first glance.

parsing programming languages with parser combinators can be a bit hard sometimes, moreover when indentation is meaningful. 
But I plan to add more parsing backends for that.
